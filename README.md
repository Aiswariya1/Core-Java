# Core-Java_Basic
### Description :-
Core Java refers to the fundamental concepts of Java programming used to build reliable and platform-independent applications. It focuses on the core language features and object-oriented principles required for software development.

## Key Topics Covered in Core Java -

### Java Basics :-

- Java syntax and structure

- Identifier 

- Datatypes (primitive & non-primitive)

- Type-Casting (implicit & explicit)

- Variables (Instance/ Non-static, Static, Local )
          
- Operators <br>
(i.Unary-Increment(pre & post), Decrement(pre & post))<br>
(ii.Binary-Arithmetic,Relational,Bitwise,Equality,Assignment,Logical)<br>
(iii.Ternary)

###  Control Statements :-

Conditional statements <br>(if, if-else, switch)

Looping statements<br> (for, while, do-while)

Jump statements <br>(break, continue, return)
